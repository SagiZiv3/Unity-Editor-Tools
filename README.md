# Unity-Editor-Tools

This repository contains a suite of powerful and convenient tools designed to enhance the functionality of the
[Unity Editor](https://unity.com/products/unity-platform) and enhance your development experience. From animation
curve generation to a powerful Windows project launcher, this collection provides valuable solutions to common Unity
Editor challenges and makes game development more efficient and enjoyable.

For example, the SerializedReferences initializer. This tool enables
developers to initialize the reference for fields that have been marked with the `SerializeReference` attribute, making it
easier to create and work with complex or multi-faceted game objects. By allowing developers to assign references to
Unity objects such as `MonoBehaviour` and `ScriptableObject` to a `SerializeReference` field, this tool expands the scope of
Unity's functionality and allows developers to create more versatile and customizable projects with cleaner code.

Other tools in this collection include the animation curve generator, a versatile and intuitive animation tool
that simplifies the process of creating customized `AnimationCurve`s with pre-defined mathematical formulas and the
ability to add your own.

The Windows project launcher is another powerful addition, simplifying the process of opening an existing project from
Windows File Explorer by automatically starting the Unity Editor and the default IDE in a new virtual-desktop.

Overall, this GitHub repository is an excellent resource for any Unity developer looking to optimize their workflows and
create more versatile, powerful projects. Whether you are new to Unity or an experienced developer, these tools will
undoubtedly prove invaluable in your development process.
